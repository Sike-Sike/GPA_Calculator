# GPA_Calculator
This is a python script to calculate your GPA.

To run this script, first clone this repository, `cd` into it and run:
```
python3 CalculateGPA.py GPA.csv
```
For this to work, both files, `CalculateGPA.py` and `GPA.csv` should be in the same directory and the formatting of `GPA.csv` should not be changed.
